                <h2>Inspired by Cookie Clicker</h2>
                <p>The inspiration behind Donut Clicker comes from the classic game <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/" target="_blank">Cookie Clicker</a>. We wanted to capture the same feeling of fun and accomplishment, with a delicious twist! Just like making real donuts, this game is about seeing your hard work pay off, one click at a time.</p>
