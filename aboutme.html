                <h2>Meet the Developer</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm the creator of the Donut Clicker game. As a passionate web developer and gaming enthusiast, I wanted to create a fun, engaging experience that captures the joy of creating something sweet, one click at a time. My love for coding and design has driven me to build interactive applications that bring a little bit of happiness to users.</p>
                <p>With a background in web development, I've always been fascinated by how a few lines of code can bring ideas to life. This project was an opportunity to blend my skills in front-end development with my creativity, resulting in a game that's simple yet satisfying.</p>
                <p>Feel free to check out my other projects and follow my journey as I continue to create fun and innovative experiences.</p>
